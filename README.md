# ServiceHandler

Small utility program made in WPF to handle my own windows services.

This project doesn't use 3rd party libraries!

Functions:
  - Install
  - Delete
  - Start
  - Stop

Every function interacts with 3rd party windows services (e.g. the ones made by me), and only with the ones, that follow the naming convention. Doesn't serve any other purpose other than making working with my windows services easier.
